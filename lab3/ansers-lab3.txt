1. What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for each exception/interrupt? (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts were delivered to the same handler, what feature that exists in the current implementation could not be provided?)
	有些exception/interrupt不用生成错误码（NOEC），如果只有单独的handler很难控制Trapframe，因为它不知道exception/interrupt的具体类型。

2. Did you have to do anything to make the user/softint program behave correctly? The grade script expects it to produce a general protection fault (trap 13), but softint's code says int $14. Why should this produce interrupt vector 13? What happens if the kernel actually allows softint's int $14 instruction to invoke the kernel's page fault handler (which is interrupt vector 14)?
	不需要。因为14是有权限的，用户态无法抛出此中断，在softin中调用产生了trap 13的权限错误。



3. The break point test case will either generate a break point exception or a general protection fault depending on how you initialized the break point entry in the IDT (i.e., your call to SETGATE from trap_init). Why? How do you need to set it up in order to get the breakpoint exception to work as specified above and what incorrect setup would cause it to trigger a general protection fault?
	如前面所述，在SETGATE中设定了t_brkpt权限为3，仅由kernel态完成。

4. What do you think is the point of these mechanisms, particularly in light of what the user/softint test program does?
	关键点在于权限的设定，user/softint如题2，使用指令int $14，产生了异常13并进入了kernel态。
